> Perform Bayesian modelling in R using JAGS.

:rocket: This is the **development version** of the `R` package `R2jags` (currently on version `r packageDescription("R2jags")$Version`). The stable version is now release `r utils::available.packages(filters = "CRAN")["R2jags",2]`, on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R2jags/index.html).

## Overview

`R2jags` provides a set of wrapper functions to implement Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (specifically, Gibbs sampling) in [`JAGS`](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/). Some major features include monitoring convergence of a MCMC model using Gelman-Rubin Potential Scale Reduction ("Rhat") statistics, automatically running a MCMC model until it converges, and implementing parallel processing of a MCMC model for multiple chains.

## Features
Main features of `R2jags` include:

* Wrapping functions from `rjags` and `R2WinBUGS` to run `JAGS` in the background and produce a MCMC analysis of a given model.
* Summary statistics and tables
* Convergence and auto-correlation calculations and plots

## Installation
Install the [released version from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=R2jags) with

```r
install.packages("R2jags")
```

The development version (in this repo, which can be updated more quickly and more often than the stable one) can be installed from `r-universe.dev`, using the following command

```r
install.packages(
  'R2jags', 
  repos = c('https://giabaio.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version using `remotes`, with the following command.

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("giabaio/R2jags",ref="devel")
```

**NB**: On Windows machines, you need to install a few dependencies, including [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) first, e.g. by running

```r
pkgs <- c("MASS", "Rtools", "remotes")
repos <- "https://cran.rstudio.com"
install.packages(pkgs, repos = repos, dependencies = "Depends")
```

before installing the package using `remotes`.
